# Qunatum_Visaulization-
This code aims to help you visualize quantum mechanics.

**Travelling wave: **

This notebook visualizes the **real** and **imaginary** parts of a basic quantum **plane wave**:

$$
\psi(x) = e^{ikx} = \cos(kx) + i\sin(kx)
$$

It represents a **free particle** moving in space with wave number $k = 1$.
By running this code, you'll see how the wavefunction behaves, showing its complex structure clearly through:

* **Re\[ψ(x)]** → cosine wave
* **Im\[ψ(x)]** → sine wave

This is a fundamental starting point for visualizing quantum mechanics as wave-based behavior.
